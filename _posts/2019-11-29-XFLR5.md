XFLR5 is THE program to do the aerodynamics and flight dynamics calculations with - at least as an open source solution. 
Disclaimer: I'm doing everything on Ubuntu 19.04.
While there is a packaged version of XFLR5 in the package sources of Ubuntu & Debian this is REALLY old and had a few bugs bugging me. Three solutions for me to get a newer version:
- Compile from source
    - Didn't work for me really, as there were always errors, but I did not spend too much time on it trying to solve all problems. There are a few projects on github (or somewhere else), which try to provide working compile scripts, which also did not work for me.
- Windows Version with WINE
    - Works flawlessly on one of my computers, which already had wine on it.
- Compile from source USING Qt Creator
    - XFLR5 uses Qt and is generally made as a Qt Creator project. The following steps worked for me perfectly on the first try:
        - [Download XFLR5 form sourceforge.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xflr5/)
        - Install Qt Creator from package sources.
        - Open the Qt Creator project file with Qt Creator (xflr5.pro coming with sources)
        - In the project settings in Qt Creator set:
            - Build directory to whatever you like
            - Build configuration to "Release"
            - "Run configuration" to "xflr5-gui" 
            - Check "Add build library search path..."
            - Press the play button
            - ???
            - profit.
            - YMMV.
