This blog will show my progess with creating a 3d printed model airplane. As I got the idea for this website some time later in the progress of this project, so some of the posts are logically behind the plane CAD etc. in the repository.

However, if you cannot wait for the posts, feel free to look into [the plane design repository.](https://github.com/mpsdskd/3D-Print-Plane)

Of course, contributions are welcome as well.
