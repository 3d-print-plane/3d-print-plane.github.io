This blog will show my progess with creating a 3d printed model airplane. As I got the idea for this website some time later in the progress of this project, I will write posts dated back roughly to when I did whatever I'm writing about, probably based on git commit dates or something. If this blog reaches the "NOW" I will write a notification post.

However, if you cannot wait for the posts, feel free to look into [the plane design repository.](https://github.com/mpsdskd/3D-Print-Plane)

Of course, contributions are welcome as well.
