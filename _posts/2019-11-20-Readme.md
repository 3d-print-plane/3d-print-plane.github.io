- Manufacturing technique fixed as FDM
- Restrictions of FDM:
    - Fixed maximum size: ~190x190x190mm³ bounding box
        - Wing needs to be printed in parts, parts need to be connected stabily
    - Highly anisotropic material -> Parts brittle perpendicular to layers
    - Rough surface perpendicular to layer lines
        - rough parts approx. along airflow
    - "low resolution" in z (-> Layer height)
        - Wing must be printed vertically with layer = xy-plane
    - Reinforcements can be made by constructing very slim Cuts into the model. On Both sides of the cut the Slicer will create wall lines, thus adding additional plastic in places needed
        - Useful with reinforcements for wing spar, and screws
        - Create ribs by making a cut through the wing

- Maximum lightweight design
    - <500g for personal insurance purposes
    - ↓weight -> ↓Sinkrate
        - useful for (dynamic) soaring
    - just because
    - How to achieve this with FDM?
        - Build hollow
        - Low wall thicknesses -> 1 trace
        - Rigidity & form stability still necessary for aerodynamic shapes
            - Wing ribs, reinforcements necessary at important positions
        - Spar as structural element from Aluminium or CFK


- Aerodynamics
    - Flying wing
        - ↑ Efficiency
        - Challenges:
            - Equilibrium of Moments
            - Adverse Yaw
            - Yaw stability
            - Controlability
            -CoG
        - Elevons

- General ideas
    - Modular construction 
        - Just print new, whatever broke, not the whole thing 
            - Parts must not be glued, but screwed together
