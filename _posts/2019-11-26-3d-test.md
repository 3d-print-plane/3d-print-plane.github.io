## Can this work at all?

For hand launch, my personal insurance and the plane's general ability to fly sensibly, the mass of the airframe, as constructed must be minimized. With this test wing, according to Cura, the mass of this 200 mm wing segment is around 40g, bringing the whole wing weight to ca. 150g - works for me.

<dl>
    <div id="mycanvas" style="position:absolute; background-color:#000000; left:0; height:50vh; width:100%"> </div>
   <div style="position:relative; height:50vh; width:0px"></div>
    <script src = "/assets/3js/three.js"></script>
    <script src = "/assets/3d.js"></script> 
    <script src = "/assets/3js/OrbitControls.js"></script>
    <script src = "/assets/3js/PLYLoader.js"></script>
    <script src = "/assets/3js/AMFLoader.js"></script>
    <script src = "/assets/3js/OBJLoader.js"></script>
    <script src = "/assets/3js/stats.js"></script>
    <script>
        makeScene("mycanvas", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpsdskd/3D-Print-Plane/master/3d-test/1_Test_wing.obj", 0.01, 0,-1.4,0,    -Math.PI/2,0,0); 
        render();
    </script>
</dl>

So this project might be possible :)
